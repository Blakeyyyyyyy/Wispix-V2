## **ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If you get "unknown file attribute" errors:**
- This is a terminal display issue, not a deployment problem
- The commands should still work despite the error messages

### **If deployment fails:**
1. Check that all environment variables are set
2. Ensure Node.js version is set to 18.x in Vercel settings
3. Check the deployment logs in Vercel dashboard

### **If API endpoints don't work:**
1. Verify environment variables are set correctly
2. Check that Supabase database has the new tables
3. Test with the basic test script: `npm run test:tools`

---

### **1. Test the System**
```bash
npm run test:tools
```

### **2. Manual Testing**
1. Go to your deployed Vercel URL
2. Create a new automation thread
3. Send message: "List records from my Airtable base"
4. Verify credential popup appears
5. Enter test credentials
6. Verify execution plan is created
7. Click Execute and verify it runs
