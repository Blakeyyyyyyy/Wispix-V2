# Stale Execution Fix - Wispix Platform

## 🚨 Problem Identified
Automations were showing as "running" when they weren't actually executing. This was caused by:

1. **Missing stale execution cleanup in cron job** - Only manual executions had cleanup logic
2. **No timeout handling during step processing** - Executions could get stuck indefinitely
3. **Insufficient error handling for webhook failures** - Failed webhook calls didn't properly update execution status

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Stale Execution Cleanup to Cron Job
**File**: `api/cron/process-automations.js`

- Added cleanup logic at the beginning of the cron job
- Cleans up executions running for more than 15 minutes
- Marks stale executions as "failed" with appropriate error message
- Added logging for better debugging

```javascript
// Clean up stale running executions (running for more than 15 minutes)
const fifteenMinutesAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 15 * 60 * 1000).toISOString();
const { data: staleExecutions, error: staleError } = await supabase
  .from('flow_executions')
  .select('id, status, created_at, automation_id, thread_id')
  .eq('status', 'running')
  .lt('created_at', fifteenMinutesAgo);
```

### 2. Added Execution Timeout Protection
**File**: `api/cron/process-automations.js`

- Added 20-minute maximum execution time limit
- Automatically marks long-running executions as failed
- Prevents executions from running indefinitely

```javascript
// Check if execution has been running too long (timeout protection)
const executionStartTime = new Date(execution.started_at || execution.created_at);
const executionDuration = Date.now() - executionStartTime.getTime();
const maxExecutionTime = 20 * 60 * 1000; // 20 minutes

if (executionDuration > maxExecutionTime) {
  // Mark as failed and return
}
```

### 3. Improved Webhook Error Handling
**File**: `api/cron/process-automations.js`

- Added try-catch around webhook calls
- Immediate failure handling for webhook errors
- Proper status updates and activity logging

```javascript
try {
  responseText = await callAgentWithPolling(webhookPayload, i + 1);
} catch (webhookError) {
  // Mark execution as failed immediately
  // Add error to activity log
  // Return to stop processing
}
```

### 4. Added Old Scheduled Execution Cleanup
**File**: `api/cron/process-automations.js`

- Cleans up scheduled executions older than 1 hour
- Prevents accumulation of old scheduled executions
- Marks them as failed with appropriate error message

### 5. Created Manual Cleanup Endpoint
**File**: `api/cleanup-stale-executions.js`

- New API endpoint for manual cleanup testing
- Can be called via GET or POST
- Returns detailed cleanup results
- Useful for debugging and manual intervention

### 6. Created Test Script
**File**: `test-stale-execution-cleanup.js`

- Comprehensive test script to verify fixes
- Checks before and after cleanup
- Provides detailed logging and statistics
- Can be run locally for testing

## 🔧 How It Works

### Automatic Cleanup (Every Minute)
1. **Cron job runs every minute** (`*/1 * * * *`)
2. **Stale cleanup first** - Removes executions running >15 minutes
3. **Old scheduled cleanup** - Removes scheduled executions >1 hour old
4. **Process active executions** - Handles pending/running/scheduled executions
5. **Timeout protection** - Kills executions running >20 minutes
6. **Error handling** - Properly handles webhook failures

### Manual Cleanup
- Call `/api/cleanup-stale-executions` to manually trigger cleanup
- Useful for immediate cleanup or testing
- Returns detailed results of what was cleaned up

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix
- Executions could get stuck in "running" status indefinitely
- No automatic cleanup of stale executions
- Poor error handling for webhook failures
- Accumulation of old scheduled executions

### After Fix
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of stale executions every minute
- ✅ Timeout protection prevents infinite running
- ✅ Proper error handling and status updates
- ✅ Cleanup of old scheduled executions
- ✅ Manual cleanup endpoint for emergencies
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Test Script
```bash
node test-stale-execution-cleanup.js
```

### Manual Cleanup
```bash
curl https://project-6tfuunsfn-chases-projects-b3818de8.vercel.app/api/cleanup-stale-executions
```

### Check Cron Job
The cron job will automatically run every minute and log cleanup activities.

## 📈 Monitoring

### Log Messages to Watch For
- `🧹 Found stale running executions, cleaning up: X`
- `✅ Cleaned up stale executions`
- `⏰ Execution X has been running for Y minutes, marking as failed`
- `❌ Step X webhook call failed: [error]`

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Check current running executions
SELECT id, status, created_at, automation_id 
FROM flow_executions 
WHERE status = 'running' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check recent failed executions
SELECT id, status, error_message, created_at 
FROM flow_executions 
WHERE status = 'failed' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🚀 Deployment

The fixes are ready for deployment. The cron job will automatically start cleaning up stale executions once deployed.

### Files Modified
- ✅ `api/cron/process-automations.js` - Main fixes
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Added cleanup endpoint
- ✅ `api/cleanup-stale-executions.js` - New manual cleanup endpoint
- ✅ `test-stale-execution-cleanup.js` - Test script

### Files Created
- ✅ `STALE_EXECUTION_FIX.md` - This documentation

The platform should now properly handle stale executions and prevent automations from showing as running when they aren't.
