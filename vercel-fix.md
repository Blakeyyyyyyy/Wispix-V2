# üîß Fix Vercel Deployment Protection

## Issue Identified
The production URL is showing a Vercel authentication page instead of your app. This is because Vercel has deployment protection enabled.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Disable Protection via Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/chases-projects-b3818de8/project/settings/general
2. Scroll down to "Deployment Protection"
3. Disable "Password Protection" or "Vercel Authentication"
4. Save changes

### Option 2: Use Preview URL
The preview URL should work without protection:
- Check: https://vercel.com/chases-projects-b3818de8/project/deployments
- Look for the latest deployment and use its preview URL

### Option 3: Create New Project
If the above doesn't work, we can create a new Vercel project without protection.

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ App is built and deployed correctly
- ‚úÖ Supabase is configured properly
- ‚ùå Deployment protection is blocking access
- ‚úÖ Local development works (http://localhost:5173)

## Test Local Development
Your local dev server should work perfectly:
1. Visit: http://localhost:5173
2. Test the full application
3. Verify Supabase connection works

## Next Steps
1. Disable deployment protection in Vercel dashboard
2. Test the production URL
3. Configure custom domain adkitai.com
